/**
 * That the native-image registration is COMPLETE, which is the only half of it a JVM test can guard.
 *
 * <p>On a JVM every type below reflects whether anyone registered it or not, so nothing here can
 * fail for the reason the registration exists. What it can do is fail when a type joins the wire and
 * not the list — a new listener, a new payload record — and when one of the two string names stops
 * resolving, which is the failure mode a compiler cannot see at all: {@code classNames} compiles
 * whatever it says, and a stale package there costs the binary its catch-up or its payload's
 * {@code @JsonIgnore}s with no error anywhere.
 *
 * <p>The correctness proof is the binary, running, against a real qits-events. Read
 * {@link EventWireReflection}'s javadoc before adding a wire type.
