/**
 * <b>ONE JOURNEY, END TO END, ACROSS THE HOP THE RELEASE TRAINS COULD NOT MAKE: a library releases,
 * a frontend takes it, and the SERVICE THAT CARRIES THAT FRONTEND AS A SUBMODULE takes it too.</b>
 *
 * <p>The retired trains stopped at the frontend, every time, and it was a modelling failure rather
 * than a bug: membership was derived ONCE, at the release, by asking who pins the released
 * coordinate — one hop — and a submodule is not a released coordinate at all. This class is the
 * acceptance gate for the replacement, and the assertion that matters most is an EXACT one: the
 * closure of the library is {@code [frontend@1, service@2 via frontend]} and nothing else.
 *
 * <p><b>Driven through the seams a deployment uses.</b> Real {@code SoftwareRelease} frames into
 * {@link SoftwareReleaseListener}, the real work queue, real SBOM documents fetched through {@link
 * FakePeers}, and a real database. Nothing here calls a store write to fake a release: the whole
 * value of a journey test is that every seam between the frame and the answer is in it.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does NOT drive is a second listener, and that is the subtraction.</b> There used to
 * be two consumers of every {@code SoftwareRelease} — one to move {@code mt_latest} and open the
 * SBOM outbox row, a second to open the station — and the second one is gone with the tables. There
 * is one consumer of a release again, and the closure is a query.
 *
 * <p>The wrapper is in the estate on purpose. It gitlink-pins all three repositories, so an
 * implementation that did not exclude the {@code PROJECT} archetype would put it on every assertion
 * below — and then expand it, which reaches the whole platform in one hop.
