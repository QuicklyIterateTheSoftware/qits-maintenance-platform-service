/**
 * <b>{@code GET /pins} — the artifact GC's keep-set, and the images and daemon binaries inside it
 * that no manifest of anybody's spells out.</b>
 *
 * <p>One rule, asserted twice over two artifact types: the daemon block at the bottom is the image
 * block above it with {@code qits/eventstream-daemon} swapped for a binary in the platform's {@code
 * daemons} store, because that is exactly what the change was — {@code control/CarriedDaemons} is
 * {@code control/CarriedImages} over the other carried type, and both call one walk.
 *
 * <p>Container image versions are pom pins now. A repository that pins {@code
 * qits-workspace-daemon-protocol} at a version has, by that one line, named {@code qits/workspace}
 * at the same version — the release stamped both — and between the bump landing on main and that
 * repository deploying, nothing else on the platform names that image at all: the configuration
 * source that used to carry it is empty, and each launching service's own door answers for what it
 * is running rather than for what it will run next. So the assertions below are about ONE rule and
 * its edges: a keep is produced from the co-release, from nothing else, and never for a version the
 * release did not carry.
 *
 * <p>The graph is seeded through the store for the reason {@code SbomApiTest} gives — what this
 * route serves is a READ, and driving a real ingest would test somebody else's subject through six
 * more layers — while the pins come from a real scan of the fixture repository, because the whole
 * point is the join between the two.
