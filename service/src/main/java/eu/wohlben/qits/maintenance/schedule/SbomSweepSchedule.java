/**
 * The belt behind the SBOM ingest: every artifact row still waiting for its document, re-queued.
 *
 * <p><b>Hourly rather than on the bump poll, and that is the difference between the two shapes of
 * work.</b> The bump sweep runs every fifteen seconds because a bump is a live CI run whose ending
 * somebody is watching. A PENDING artifact row is not live at all — it is a fetch that was queued
 * and lost, by a restart or a shutdown mid-work — and the ordinary recovery for that is {@code
 * RestartRecovery}, which runs it at boot. What is left for this timer is the narrow case a boot
 * does not cover: a queue submission dropped while the process kept running.
 *
 * <p><b>It is not a retry of MISSING or FAILED.</b> Neither is swept, deliberately: a 404 is the
 * ordinary permanent answer for a release published before the SBOM route existed, and a released
 * version is immutable, so asking again asks about the same bytes. What moves either is {@code
 * POST /artifacts/ingest}, a person who knows something changed.
 *
 * <p><b>A no-op whenever nothing is pending</b>, which is nearly always: it is one indexed read of
 * {@code mt_artifact} by status and a return.
