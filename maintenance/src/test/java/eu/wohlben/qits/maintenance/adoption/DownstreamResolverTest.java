/**
 * <b>The closure itself: who is downstream, how far, and through what.</b>
 *
 * <p>This is the piece that fixes the release trains' one real defect. A train derived its
 * membership once, at the release, with a single one-hop pass — so a library's journey named the
 * frontend that pins it and stopped there, for ever. The first test below is that bug, written as
 * the assertion it should always have had: <b>exactly</b> the frontend at depth 1 and the service at
 * depth 2, reached through the gitlink pin that makes the second hop exist at all.
 *
 * <p><b>Every fixture name carries a uuid</b>, because this module has no {@code InventoryReset} and
 * the resolver reads the WHOLE inventory: a fixed name would let one method's estate answer another
 * method's question. What it deliberately does NOT do is empty the store — a closure rooted at a
 * repository nothing else names is unaffected by whatever else is in there, and proving that is
 * worth more than an isolated database.
 *
 * <p>The {@link DownstreamResolver#MAX_REPOSITORIES} bound has no test of its own and that is a
 * deliberate omission: reaching it means seeding five hundred repositories that then sit in the
 * shared database for every method after it. The bound is asserted as a value, the depth bound is
 * driven for real, and the two share one guard.
