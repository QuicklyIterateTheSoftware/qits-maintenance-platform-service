/**
 * <b>The releases that happened before the ledger existed, read at boot.</b>
 *
 * <p>{@code adoption/ReleaseLedger} is filled by {@code bus/ScmEventListener}, one row per release
 * as it is announced — which makes the adoption view correct from the next release wave onwards and
 * wrong until then. On a frontend that is weeks. So the first boot after this deploys fills in what
 * the estate has already released, and the view is right at the deploy instead.
 *
 * <p><b>The source is {@code mt_latest}'s GITLINK rows, and it is the only source there is.</b>
 * Nothing else on this platform writes down "this repository released this version, at this commit"
 * — a registry knows versions of a PACKAGE and not of a repository, and a frontend publishes no
 * package at all. That listener has been recording a gitlink latest for every release since it
 * landed, version and tag sha together, so the newest release of every repository the bus has
 * announced is sitting there waiting to be re-read at its tag.
 *
 * <p><b>ONE release per repository, and that is the whole of what a backfill can honestly be.</b>
 * {@code mt_latest} keeps the newest, so the history before it is not recoverable from anything
 * here. That is enough for the question this serves: a journey asks who is carrying a release NOW,
 * and a consumer's newest release is the one that answers it.
 *
 * <h2>Where it runs, and why not in the boot thread</h2>
 *
 * <p>Queued on {@link WorkQueue}, the single writer, exactly as every scan and every bump is — so
 * it is behind whatever the boot already queued, it cannot interleave with a scan rewriting the
 * inventory it reads, and the git host sees one caller. And it does not hold the boot: the catalog
 * is tens of rows and one hop each, but each hop is somebody else's HTTP, and a service that is not
 * there at all is worse than one whose adoption view fills in a minute later.
 *
 * <p><b>Skipping, per row, and none of the three skips is a failure.</b> A latest with no version,
 * a {@code source_url} that yields no sha (a row written before the sha was recorded, or by another
 * writer), a release the ledger already holds, and a repository the inventory has no row for — the
 * last is the only one worth a word: a ledger read needs a PROJECT to address the git host with,
 * that value lives on {@code mt_repository}, and a gitlink whose submodule name is not a catalog
 * name has no such row. It is a DEBUG rather than a WARN because it is the ordinary state of an
 * estate whose gitlinks outnumber its catalog.
 *
 * <p><b>A failure is one repository's, never the run's</b> — the standing rule of every loop in
 * this service that reads a peer per row. One unreachable git host costs one ledger row, and the
 * next boot asks again.
