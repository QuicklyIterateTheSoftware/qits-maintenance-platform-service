/**
 * <b>THE ONE RULE BOTH DERIVATIONS ARE:</b> for a stored pin at {@code (ecosystem, name, version)}
 * that is internal maven or npm, the repository that RELEASED that coordinate, and everything of a
 * given kind that same repository released at that same version.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is one algorithm and not two copies.</b> {@link CarriedImages} wrote it for
 * container images; {@link CarriedDaemons} needed it verbatim for daemon binaries, differing in two
 * tokens — which artifact rows count, and what the derived row's {@code ecosystem} says. The parts
 * that are easy to get subtly wrong are all in the shared half: the de-duplication by (carried name,
 * version, PINNING repository, manifest path) so one release reached through two carriers is one
 * row; the {@code via} that keeps a derived row from ever being read as a line somebody wrote; and
 * the rule that a manifest which already writes the coordinate out wins, because its row is the one
 * a bump can edit. Two copies of those would be two places to fix the day one of them is wrong.
 *
 * <p>What is NOT shared is the reasoning, and that is deliberate: each caller's javadoc says which
 * hole in the keep-set it closes and what was measured, because those are different facts about
 * different stores with different retention.
 *
 * <p><b>No artifact row, no keep.</b> A version this service never saw released resolves to nothing
 * at all, rather than to a name invented for it — the same honesty either caller would want on its
 * own. The window that matters is the freshly released version, whose row {@code
 * SoftwareReleaseListener} writes off the frame.
