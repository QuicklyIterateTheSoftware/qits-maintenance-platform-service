/**
 * How a gitlink's commit sha rides in {@code mt_latest.source_url}.
 *
 * <p><b>Why that column and not a new one.</b> A released version and the commit it was cut from are
 * one fact about one release, and {@code source_url} is already "where this claim came from" — a
 * registry url for a poll, {@code event:<frame id>} for the bus. A gitlink's claim comes from a tag
 * in the git host, so the sha IS the provenance, and a column added to carry it would be a
 * migration and a second nullable field that only one of four ecosystems ever fills.
 *
 * <p><b>Two readers and one writer, so the spelling lives here.</b> {@code bus/ScmEventListener}
 * writes it; the pending rule and the repository page read it. A second spelling of {@code "sha:"}
 * would be the one that failed to match, silently, as "nothing is pending".
