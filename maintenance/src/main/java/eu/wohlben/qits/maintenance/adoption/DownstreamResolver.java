/**
 * <b>WHO IS DOWNSTREAM OF A REPOSITORY, TRACED TO THE END — computed on every read, stored
 * nowhere.</b>
 *
 * <p>This replaces the persisted release train, and the reason it replaces it is a modelling
 * mistake rather than a bug: a train wrote its membership down ONCE, at the release, with a single
 * one-hop pass. A library release therefore named the frontend that pins it and never the service
 * that consumes that frontend — the journey "cut off at frontend", every time, and no amount of
 * evaluation afterwards could add a hop the membership never had. Everything needed to answer the
 * question properly is already here: {@code mt_pin} says what a manifest DECLARES and {@code
 * mt_artifact_component} says what a release CONTAINS, and both are refreshed by mechanisms that
 * already run. So the closure is a query, taken to the very end, and there is no table.
 *
 * <h2>Two sides, one union, and the gitlink is what makes the second hop exist</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The DECLARED side</b> — every repository holding an INTERNAL {@code mt_pin} on one of the
 *       coordinates. A pin is a line somebody wrote and somebody can edit, which is what makes an
 *       adoption possible at all.
 *   <li><b>The EVIDENCE side</b> — every repository whose newest released artifact's bill of
 *       materials names one of them ({@code MaintenanceStore.dependents}). An SBOM sees transitives,
 *       which no manifest names.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>And a repository's own NAME is a coordinate here, in the GITLINK ecosystem.</b> That
 * synthetic pair is the whole frontend→service hop: a frontend is a service's {@code
 * service/src/main/webui} submodule, {@code GitmodulesParser} records the submodule's repository
 * name as the pin's {@code name}, and {@code MaintenanceConfig.kindOf} hardcodes GITLINK→INTERNAL.
 * So "who submodules this repository" is already an indexed answer over {@code (ecosystem, name)},
 * and unioning it in is what stops the closure at a frontend from being the end of the road. The
 * old train excluded GITLINK on purpose — because the WRAPPER gitlink-pins every submodule on the
 * platform — and that exclusion is kept, in the shape it should always have had: the wrapper is
 * dropped by its ARCHETYPE, not by pretending the ecosystem does not exist.
 *
 * <h2>What terminates it</h2>
 *
 * <p>The estate's dependency graph is not guaranteed acyclic and this runs inside a human GET, so
 * there are three belts and each is a different failure: the <b>visited set</b> makes a cycle a
 * finite walk, {@link #MAX_DEPTH} bounds a chain longer than any estate this platform will have, and
 * {@link #MAX_REPOSITORIES} bounds an answer nobody could read anyway. Hitting either bound is a
 * WARN and a truncated answer, never an exception: an announce path on the other side of this route
 * must not break because a graph got strange.
 *
 * <p><b>Pure reads, no HTTP, no writes.</b> Everything here is one pass over {@code repositories()}
 * and {@code allPins()} held in memory, plus one {@code dependents} read per coordinate per level.
