 * array of the {@code MaintenanceBump} trigger and stored verbatim on the bump row. The field names
 * are the plan's and a rename here is a change to a contract two repositories build against.
 *
 * @param ecosystem which of the pipeline's two steps can apply it
 * @param manifestPath the file to edit, repository-relative
 * @param name the dependency
 * @param from the version in the file now, so the step can refuse an edit against a file that moved
 * @param to the version to write
 * @param location where in the file: a property, a dependency element, a block or a line number
