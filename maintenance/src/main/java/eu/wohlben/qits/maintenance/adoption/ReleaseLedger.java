/**
 * <b>WHAT A RELEASE DECLARED, recorded once at the moment it is announced.</b>
 *
 * <p>An adoption needs evidence, and until this class there was exactly one kind of it: a component
 * row in the consumer's own released bill of materials. That rule is right and it is not enough.
 * Measured live on 2026-09-08 against {@code qits-ui-components-jslib 2026.906.164412} — fifteen
 * frontends at depth 1, fifteen services at depth 2, every one of them reported PENDING and every
 * one of them in fact carrying the release for weeks. A frontend publishes no registry artifact at
 * all (its release is a git tag, consumed by the embedding service's gitlink bump), and a service's
 * docker-image SBOM holds maven components only — 239 of them and no npm ones — because the
 * compiled Angular dist carries no npm metadata. Neither hop had a document that could ever name
 * the coordinate.
 *
 * <h2>Why a pin is allowed to be evidence here</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link AdoptionEvaluator} refuses a pin, and it is right to: a pin read at {@code main} is a
 * fact about somebody's WORKING TREE. Nothing polls it, it moves under you, and it is revertible,
 * so a verdict computed from one would flicker. <b>A pin read at {@code refs/tags/<version>} is a
 * different fact.</b> A tag is immutable and it is tied to the consumer's own released version —
 * which is the very thing an adoption is reported as. So the philosophy already written into that
 * class, that the evidence is about a RELEASE rather than a working tree, is satisfied by the tag,
 * and it is obtainable for a repository that publishes nothing to any registry.
 *
 * <h2>What is kept, and what is dropped</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>INTERNAL only</b>, by {@link MaintenanceConfig#kindOf(ParsedPin)}. EXTERNAL is somebody
 * else's package and nothing of ours releasing it makes anybody downstream; REACTOR is the
 * repository's own artifact, whose version no line anywhere holds; UNRESOLVED never became a
 * version at all. <b>GITLINK survives that filter without a special case</b>, because {@code
 * kindOf} hardcodes it INTERNAL — a submodule is a repository on this platform's own git host and
 * nothing else can be one — and it is the half that matters most: it is the whole frontend→service
 * hop, and its {@code version} is the embedded commit sha rather than a version.
 *
 * <h2>Failure, and why the split is the listener's</h2>
 *
 * <p>The one caller on the bus path is {@code bus/ScmEventListener}, inside a durable claim, so
 * this holds the same three-way split that method does:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a git host that cannot be ASKED is retryable and is <b>thrown</b> — the frame stays owed and
 *       the next sweep offers it again, which is the only thing that recovers a ledger row nothing
 *       else ever writes;
 *   <li>a tag the host does not HOLD is poison — the same question has the same answer for ever —
 *       so it is a WARN and a return recording nothing;
 *   <li>a manifest that would not parse records <b>whatever parsed</b>. The parsers already drop
 *       what they cannot read (see {@code ManifestScanner}), and a release whose pom listing was
 *       half-readable declared the other half all the same.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The write is idempotent and that is not incidental</b>: a durable redelivery and a backfill
 * re-run both land on {@code (repository, version)}, and {@link MaintenanceStore#recordRelease}
 * rewrites the row and its pins rather than adding to them.
