/**
 * The one way this service touches another.
 *
 * <p><b>The JDK's HttpClient, not a REST client</b>, and the orchestrator's reasons: a peer's
 * answer stays an opaque document rather than a bound record, so nothing here is a second copy of
 * five other repositories' response shapes. It also has to read bodies that are not JSON at all —
 * a {@code maven-metadata.xml} and a raw blob — which a JSON-bound client would make awkward.
 *
 * <p><b>Two credentials on every call, and they are not alternatives.</b> {@code X-Qits-User} /
 * {@code X-Qits-Roles} are the forward-auth pair a peer accepts on the platform's own network; the
 * bearer, where a client is enabled, is the machine track. The roles header carries
 * {@code qits:system} and only that: every peer route this service calls is a machine route, and
 * {@code qits:admin} is the human role — a bump asked for by a person is still this service
 * calling.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing throws.</b> A scan reads every repository in the catalog, so one unreachable peer
 * must cost one row's status and not the run.
 *
 * <p><b>A response is bounded.</b> A packument for a popular package is megabytes of version
 * history and this service reads one field out of it; an unbounded read would let one dependency's
 * release count decide this process's heap.
