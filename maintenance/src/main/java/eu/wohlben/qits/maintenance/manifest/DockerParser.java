/**
 * Reads the {@code FROM} lines of one Dockerfile — and the {@code ARG} defaults a
 * {@code FROM ${…}} resolves from.
 *
 * <p><b>A FROM line's location is a LINE NUMBER</b>, because that is the only address a FROM has.
 * There is no key, no element and no property: a file with two stages built from the same image has
 * two lines, and each is bumped on its own.
 *
 * <p><b>An ARG line's location is {@code arg:<name>}, and that is the better address of the two.</b>
 * Three repositories on this platform pin their base image in an {@code ARG} default rather than on
 * the FROM itself — {@code ARG WORKSPACE_IMAGE=…/qits/workspace:2026.902.181302} followed by
 * {@code FROM ${WORKSPACE_IMAGE}} — because a build argument is what {@code docker build
 * --build-arg} can override and a literal FROM is not. The build argument's NAME is stable across
 * every edit made above it, where a line number goes stale on the first commit that adds a comment.
 *
 * <p><b>An image is recorded WITHOUT its registry host, whichever instruction wrote it</b>, and that
 * is what lets an ARG pin be the same kind of name a FROM pin is. An ARG default has to be an
 * address a {@code docker build} can pull on its own — a bare {@code qits/workspace} would resolve
 * to Docker Hub — so it carries the host by construction, while a FROM inside qits-ci resolves
 * through a configured mirror and does not. The two spell one image, and one image is one row:
 * {@code qits/workspace}, which is the spelling {@code mt_latest} is keyed by (qits-ci's
 * {@code SoftwareRelease} publishes {@code qits/workspace}) and the spelling the OCI tag listing is
 * addressed with. {@code bus/SoftwareReleaseListener} states that contract and names this parser as
 * the side that keeps it; see {@link #unqualified}.
 *
 * <p><b>A digest pin is not read.</b> {@code FROM image@sha256:…} names a content address rather
 * than a version, and there is no ordering over content addresses — a "newer" one is a decision
 * somebody else made.
 *
 * <p><b>A tagless {@code FROM} is not read either.</b> It means {@code :latest}, which is a moving
 * reference; there is nothing to compare and nothing to write.
 *
 * <p><b>An ARG value is held to MORE than a FROM's word, because an ARG says less.</b> A FROM line
 * declares outright that its word is an image; an ARG declares only a default, and the Dockerfiles
 * on this platform put ports, download URLs and plain version numbers in them beside the one base
 * image. So a value becomes a pin only when nothing else can explain it — see {@link #argument}.
 *
 * <p><b>Which images survive is not decided here.</b> This parser reports every reference it can
 * read and the scanner keeps only the ones the internal image prefixes claim — v1 does not order
 * external base tags, because tag order across vendors is a later decision.
