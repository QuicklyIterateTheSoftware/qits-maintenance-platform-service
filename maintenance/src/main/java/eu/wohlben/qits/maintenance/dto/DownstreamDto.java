 * conversation, exactly as {@code qits-maintenance-plan.md} says.
 *
 * <p><b>The order is the information.</b> Depth ascending then name ascending, so a consumer reading
 * it top to bottom reads "upstream first" — which is what a build queue needs and the only reason
 * the field is worth carrying on an event.

 * repository this inventory has never scanned must cost it nothing.
